#Tindog_project

Tindog project is the first project after I studied front-end web development.

As in this project, I did not code any of Javascript by myself because Javascript is not yet studied at that time.

This project contains HTML and CSS as main parts.

Also, to stylize the output of web page I added font styles from google fonts, additional css style from bootstrap, icon from font awesome, and imported bootstrap javascript into my Tindog web page.
